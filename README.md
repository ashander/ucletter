To use, you will need to store a UC seal in a file `ucsealnew` (`.eps` or `.pdf`) in
the same directory where you compile the letter. For `pdflatex` use `ucsealnew.pdf`, 
for `xelatex`, use `ucsealnew.eps`.

As of 2016-04-11, you could obtain an eps seal [here](solarmuri.ssl.berkeley.edu/~welsch/public/software/ucsealnew.eps)
this can be converte to pdf at the command line using `epstopdf`.
